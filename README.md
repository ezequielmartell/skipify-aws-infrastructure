# Django AWS Infrastructure

## Description

This is an excersize in OpenTofu(Terraform). I coupled my skipify repos with this project to learn a little about TF. I was the appropriate amount of overwhelmed doing this, and I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface. I am excited to learn more.

## Installation

Clone the repo, update what you need, add your secrets/env variables, and fire it up

## Usage

decent groundwork for a django, celery, sqs, rds(postgres) project with an ALB, ECS and ECR. 

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
